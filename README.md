# Automated Testing Framework for a Web Application

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **DEPI** course, developed by **ONL2_SWD6_S1** team members. The objective is to create an automated testing framework for end-to-end testing of a web application.



## Project Goals
- Develop an automated testing suite using **Selenium** or a similar framework.
- Implement test cases for **UI, functionality, and performance** testing.
- Integrate **Jira** for test case management and bug tracking.
- Use **Postman** for API testing.
- Generate detailed test reports and analyze test results.

## Technologies Used
- **Selenium WebDriver**
- **ISTQB 4**
- **Jira**
- **Postman**
- **TestNG / JUnit**
- **JMeter / Gatling**
- **CI/CD Integration (e.g., Jenkins)**

## Project Timeline

### Week 1: Setup and Test Case Development
- Set up the testing environment (Selenium WebDriver).
- Organize project structure for test scripts and reports.
- Develop initial UI test cases (navigation, button clicks, form submissions).
- Set up **Postman** for API testing.
- Integrate **Jira** for test case management.

### Week 2: Functional Testing and Report Generation
- Write detailed test cases for key workflows (e.g., login, data processing).
- Automate functional tests with **Selenium**.
- Generate reports using **TestNG** or **JUnit**.
- Expand API test cases in **Postman**.
- Set up performance testing tools (**JMeter / Gatling**).

### Week 3: Performance and UI Testing
- Write and execute performance test cases (load and stress testing).
- Enhance UI test cases (responsive design, cross-browser compatibility).
- Log and track issues in **Jira**.

### Week 4: Final Testing, Optimization, and Deployment
- Optimize the test framework using **Page Object Model**.
- Execute full test suite (UI, functional, API, performance).
- Generate final reports and document findings.
- Deploy framework for **CI/CD** integration.

## Deliverables
- Fully optimized and functional automated testing framework.
- Detailed test reports and bug analysis.
- Comprehensive documentation for test framework usage and extension.
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.

## How to Run the Tests
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the test suite using Selenium, Postman, or JMeter.
4. View test reports and analyze results.
