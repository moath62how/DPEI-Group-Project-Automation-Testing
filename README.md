- Perform **UI, functional, API, and performance testing**.
- Integrate **Jira** for test case management and bug tracking.
- Use **Postman** for API testing.
- Generate detailed test reports.

## Technologies Used
- **Selenium WebDriver** (for UI automation)  
- **Postman** (for API testing)  
- **JMeter / Gatling** (for performance testing)  
- **TestNG / JUnit** (for report generation)  
- **Jira** (for bug tracking)  
- **CI/CD Integration** (e.g., Jenkins)

- Develop initial UI test cases for:
  - **Login/Logout**
  - **Basic Navigation**
- Set up **Postman** for API testing.
- Integrate **Jira** for test management.

### Week 2: Functional Testing and Report Generation
- Automate test cases for:
  - **Employee creation, update, deletion** (CRUD)
  - **Role-based access tests**  
- Generate test reports using **TestNG / JUnit**.
- Expand API test cases in **Postman**.
- Set up **JMeter / Gatling** for performance testing.

### Week 3: Performance and UI Testing
- Execute **load and stress tests** on the OrangeHRM dashboard.
- Test UI across different browsers and screen sizes.
- Log and track issues in **Jira**.

### Week 4: Final Testing, Optimization, and Deployment
